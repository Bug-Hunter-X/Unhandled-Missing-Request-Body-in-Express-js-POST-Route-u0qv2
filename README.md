# Unhandled Missing Request Body in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js applications:  failure to handle cases where a POST request body is missing or malformed.  The provided `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

## Problem

The `bug.js` example defines a POST route `/user` that expects a JSON payload containing user data.  However, it lacks error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the request body is either absent or improperly formatted.  Without proper handling, the application may crash or return unexpected results.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file corrects this by adding comprehensive error handling. It checks for the presence of the `req.body` and its properties, providing appropriate responses to clients in case of missing or invalid data.  This enhances robustness and prevents unexpected application behavior.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run `node bug.js` to execute the buggy code.  Send a POST request to `/user` with and without a body to observe the behavior.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to execute the corrected code and see the improved error handling.
